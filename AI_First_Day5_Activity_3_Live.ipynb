You know it’s \\nvery true.\\nWhen you go through the motions of your daily, weekly, \\nand monthly expenses, it’s difficult to always keep track \\nof all the money you have. Sometimes, you get caught \\nunawar', 'e that you have already overspent or dipped \\nunnecessarily into your savings!\\nThat’s why people adopt different strategies or diskarte to \\nmanage their money. However, these strategies are only \\none part of the equation. There’s more to money than just \\nbeing thrifty or matipid .\\nThat’s where the principles of financial wellness comes in!\\n6CHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT FINANCIAL WELLNESS\\n7HOW FINANCIAL EDUCATION \\nHELP YOU ACHIEVE \\nFINANCIAL WELLNESS\\nThe goal of Financial Education (FinEd) is to provide \\n', 'you with information and knowledge that can help you \\nmake more confident decisions in using your money. \\nThrough FinEd, you can improve your current financial \\nstrategy to ensure that you are making the most of \\nyour financial situation.\\nFinEd can help you in the following ways:\\nBroaden and deepen your \\npersonal understanding of \\nthe value of savingsGain insight into the best \\npractices involving personal \\nmoney management Familiarize yourself with \\nstrategies and tools that help \\nimprove your ', 'relationship with \\nyour moneyLearn more about the different \\nfinancial programs that are \\nreadily available for you\\nBUT WAIT!\\nThere are no surefire get-rich-\\nquick schemes.

CHAPTE', 'R 1: ALL ABOUT FINANCIAL WELLNESS\\n8THE LIFE STAGES OF \\nHAVING MONEY\\nTake a look at this graph of how much money you usually have through the stages of life:\\nThe  lime green line  is a simplified \\ndrawing of how we expect a \\nperson’s money to grow during \\nthe three life stages.A common financial goal that everyone has is to \\nhave more money.\\nIt makes a lot of sense: it’s better to have more \\nmoney today than you did yesterday. But how \\nrealistic is that goal, really?\\nSCHOOL WORK (EMPLOYMENT OR EN', 'TERPRISE) RETIREMENT\\nHowever, the light teal line  is a \\nmore realistic one. Why? — Simplified\\n— RealisticCHAPTER 1: ALL ABOUT FINANCIAL WELLNESS\\n9When you take these big expenses \\ninto account, it’s hard to have a \\nconsistent and stable financial \\nsituation. The unplanned \\nexpenses, especially, can really \\ngive you a difficult time. Hospital bills and house repairs \\nare not normally part of your \\nbudget, so when you have to pay \\nfor a big amount all of a sudden, \\nthis can really hurt your savin', 'gs!\\nBut you know what? Here’s the truth: THIS IS NORMAL \\nFOR EVERYONE.  Everyone goes \\nthrough difficulties in trying to \\nmanage their money! \\nFACING THESE DIFFICULTIES HEAD ON\\nIf everyone goes through it, it \\nmeans that you don’t have to feel \\nbad about having a hard time. \\nYou are experiencing something \\nnormal—these are the life stages \\nof having money!\\nThere is an advantage here. If you \\nknow that you will inevitably go \\nthrough this, that means you \\ncan prepare. A great way to prepare for t', 'hese \\ndifficulties is to set clear goals. \\nClear goals provide us with clear \\ndirections and steps towards \\nachieving our goals.

To \\nmake this happen, they need to have a home to call their \\nown and retirement funds to live on. But with two kids \\nand the typical challenges of life—sickness in the family, \\nemergency expenses, among many others—Mang Rafael \\nfound it difficult to save money. \\nDetermined to bring his wife home, he began cultivating \\nvegetables to se', 'll for additional income. By living simply \\nand within their means, Mang Rafael has now been able \\nto open a savings account. With Mang Rafael’s newly-\\nfounded business and his wife’s regular income, they were \\nable to eventually purchase a house and land. He said \\nthat the key to saving efficiently are the values of “ tipid, \\nsipag, at tiyaga ” and also being faithful to your partner \\nand family.\\n12CASE STUDY: MANG RAFAEL ’S SAVING PROBLEMCOMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT SAVINGCHAPTER 2: ALL ABOUT S', 'AVING\\nSometimes, it’s hard to start saving because you think certain things have to fall into place first.

She tried contacting the company \\nrepresentative she had spoken to, but to no avail. It was \\nthen that she realized that it was all an investment scam.\\nTo avoid the same fate, Corporal Star advises everyone \\nto be vigilant and to research meticulously \\nbefore investing.  \\n41CASE STUDY: CORPORAL STAR GETS SCAMMED... cannot be reachedCHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n42WHAT IS AN INVESTMENT?\\nWhen people think of investment, they usually think \\nof the stock exchange. But the stock ex', 'change is only a \\nsmall part of the wider topic of investment. Simply put, \\nan investment is an asset or item acquired with the \\ngoal of generating income or appreciation. \\nIn other words, when you invest, you perform an action \\n(usually paying money or capital) in the hopes of raising \\nrevenue in the future.Now that you’ve learned how to \\ngrow your savings, how to secure \\nyourself and your family against \\nemergencies, and how to borrow \\nwisely, it’s now time to learn \\nhow to make your money wor', 'k\\nfor you! \\nWhen people think about \\ninvestment, they usually think \\nabout rich investors who are experts in the ins and outs of a \\nstock exchange floor. But you \\ndon’t have to be a rich investor \\nto find financial success \\nthrough investing.\\nIn fact, investment products \\nnowadays are designed with \\nthe average Filipino in mind. \\nMany banks and businesses offer \\neasy and affordable investment products that allow you to \\nbegin investing. There are even \\nlegitimate mobile applications \\nthat allow ', 'you to invest through \\nyour cell phone. The possibilities \\nwith investing are almost endless. \\nAll you need is a little know-how \\nto begin your journey. CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n43WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \\nSAVING VS. INSURANCE VS. INVESTMENT?\\nIn a previous chapter, we \\ndiscussed savings which is the \\nportion of your income you \\nchoose to set aside for many \\nreasons, including emergencies \\nor large expenses. Savings are \\nusually (but not always) placed \\nin a savings account and may b', 'e \\nwithdrawn at any time. Savings \\nare, essentially, money you \\nalready have that you are \\nkeeping for a rainy day.We’ve also discussed insurance. \\nAn insurance carries with it certain \\nbenefits that an investment \\ndoes not. Insurance policies are \\nusually exempt from estate taxes, \\nspecific to medical coverage, \\nand contain a clear procedure for \\ninheritance in case of unforeseen \\ncircumstances. This is because \\ninsurance policies are meant to \\nbe a means to secure yourself or \\nyour family agai', 'nst emergencies \\nor unforeseeable calamities. On the other hand, investments \\nare more of a means to grow \\nyour money.  Investments are, \\nat heart, profit-making activities \\nwhere you, the investor, part with \\nyour money in the hope that it will \\nmultiply. Think of it like entering \\ninto a business. You enter into a \\nbusiness in order to make your \\ninitial investment (or capital) \\nearn you more money (profits). \\nThe same goes for investments. \\nThe initial money you put into \\nthe investment produ', 'ct is your \\ncapital. Any money you earn from \\nit are your profits. \\nWHAT ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS?\\nIn general, there are two main types of investments: fixed income and variable income . Fixed income grows at a steady, predictable rate \\nover time. Variable income can gain and lose you money over time.\\nVariable income investments  are investments \\nwhere the growth of your capital can change \\nfrom one period to the next. These are usually \\nriskier investments. However, they have the \\npotential', ' to earn you more money than fixed \\nincome investments. Fixed income investments are investments \\nwhere the money you receive will not change \\nfrom one period to the next. Your money grows \\nat a steady rate over time. These are more safe \\nand predictable investments. However, they \\nusually earn you less money than variable \\nincome investments.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n44There is no “better investment” between \\nfixed or variable income. Which to invest in \\nall depends on your goals and risk', ' profile.Given these definitions, which \\nkind of investment would you \\nprefer? Why? \\nAsk a friend or the person \\nseated beside you which type of \\ninvestment they prefer and why. \\nDo you have the same answer or a \\ndifferent answer?\\nChances are, your answer will \\nbe unique to you. Between fixed \\nincome and variable income \\ninvestments, there is no “better” \\ninvestment. Which investment \\nto take depends on your risk \\nappetite or profile. Some people \\nwould rather take the risk of \\na variable income', ' if it means getting a higher payout at the \\nend of the day. They are known \\nas aggressive investors. Others \\nprefer the safety of a fixed income \\ninvestment even if it means \\ngetting a lower payout compared \\nto a variable income investment. \\nThese are conservative investors. \\nAgain, it all depends on what\\nyou prefer.\\nLet’s use an example. The \\nsimplest kind of fixed income \\ninvestment is the time deposit. \\nThe graph below will show you \\nthat in this kind of investment,\\nthe money you initially p', 'ut in \\nmight not even have doubled \\nafter 30 years!PESOSFixed Income - Time Deposit\\nTime Deposit, 2% per year\\nNUMBER OF YEARS\\nAfter 30 years, your money doesn’t even double.

If you started investing \\nin 2006 in a pool of stocks that \\ninclude stocks from PLDT , Globe, \\nand Ayala Land for example, your \\ninvestment would have more than tripled in those 30 years. However, \\nthat growth isn’t consistent. There \\nwill be times when the value of \\nyour stocks will dip below the \\nvalue of the amount you originally \\ninvested. In this example, your \\nstocks lost value in 2008–2009.\\nVariable Income - Stocks\\nYEARS\\nInvesting in stocks is a wait', 'ing game.

IDENTIFYING AND \\nAVOIDING FINANCIAL \\nFRAUD AND SCAMS\\nA Ponzi scheme  is a scam \\nthat relies on the investments \\n', 'made by new investors to pay \\nearlier investors, making these \\npayments look like returns or \\nprofits from product sales. Ponzi \\nscammers promise high rates \\nof return with very little risk. \\nDon’t be fooled! Those returns \\nonly come from payments made \\nby newer investors like you. \\nThis means that you will only \\nsee a sizable return for your \\ninvestment if the scheme is able to recruit more people \\nafter you.  This is a very unstable \\nsystem and is likely to collapse \\nbefore you ever see the ea', 'rnings \\npromised to you.\\nSimilar to the Ponzi scheme, \\na pyramid scheme  relies on \\npayments made by newer \\n“recruits” to pay older investors. \\nThis fact is usually hidden \\nbehind a “product” that \\nmembers must sell. But beware: This product is \\nusually worthless or difficult \\nto sell . \\nIn a pyramid scheme, your \\nreturns depend largely on how \\nmany people you are able to \\nrecruit into the scheme and how \\nmany people your recruits are, \\nin turn, able to recruit. Like the \\nPonzi scheme, this busi', 'ness is \\nvery unstable and is likely to fail \\nbefore you ever see returns on \\nyour investment.  Ponzi and pyramid schemes use money you pay as a new investor to pay earlier investors their “returns.” Models \\nlike this only benefit initial investors (who may also be involved in the scam) and will always collapse, leaving you \\nwithout any profit on your initial investment.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n51To avoid Ponzi or pyramid schemes, consider the following questions before investing: \\nRememb', 'er that no legitimate businesses or investments \\nhave new recruits/investors as their main source of \\nfunds. If you find yourself in a situation where you are \\nbeing made to invest in such a business, don’t pursue it. \\nYou are most likely getting scammed.If the answer to any of these questions \\nis YES , you might be entering a \\npyramid scheme. Does the business you are investing in focus \\non recruitments or cash investments?\\nDoes it market products with little or no \\nreal value?\\nDoes it promise ', 'high interest or returns on \\ninvestment within a short period of time?\\nAre members compensated based on \\nnew recruits and downlines?Interactivity Portion! \\nClick on the checkboxes \\nthat apply to your \\nsituation!CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n52Here are some tips to avoid financial scams and frauds:\\n#1: Consider how \\nthe business you are \\ninvesting into makes \\nmoney.#2: Examine the \\npromise they are \\nmaking.#3: Do a quick Google \\nsearch.\\nDoes the business focus on Does the business focus on \\nrec', 'ruitments or cash investments? recruitments or cash investments? \\nDoes it market products with Does it market products with \\nlittle or no real value?

            "Common misconceptions about saving include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Low Interest Rates Make Savings Accounts Useless**: Many people believe that because savings accounts typically offer low interest rates, saving in banks is not worthwhile. However, the primary purpose of a savings account is to keep your money secure and easily accessible, rather than to generate significant growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **You Need a Large Amount to Start Saving**: Some individuals think they need a substantial amount of money to begin saving. In reality, starting with small amounts can still lead to significant savings over time, especially with consistent contributions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Saving is Only for the Wealthy**: There is a misconception that saving is only for those who already have money. In truth, anyone can save, regardless of income level, and it’s important to develop a saving habit early on.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **You Should Only Save After Paying Off Debt**: While paying off high-interest debt is important, it’s also crucial to save simultaneously. Having a small emergency fund can prevent you from going further into debt when unexpected expenses arise.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Saving is a One-Time Action**: Some people think saving is a one-time effort, like making a large deposit. However, saving is an ongoing process that involves regular contributions, no matter how small.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **You Can Only Save for Big Goals**: Many believe that saving is only for major life events, such as buying a house or retirement. In reality, saving can be for short-term goals as well, such as vacations or emergency funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Investing is Better Than Saving**: While investing can potentially offer higher returns, it also comes with risk. Saving provides security and liquidity, which can be essential for financial stability.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **You Must Have a Budget to Save**: While budgeting can help manage finances, it is not a strict requirement to start saving. Even without a formal budget, setting aside a portion of income regularly can lead to savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "By understanding and addressing these misconceptions, individuals can cultivate healthier saving habits and work towards their financial goals more effectively.\n"
